title: About the Wiki
---

This wiki site serves as the center of all project and crew-related documentation at Coderos. 

## History of the Wiki

All written documentation for the project like dev logs, ERDs, and team information used to live in [JetBrains Space](https://www.jetbrains.com/space/). This served its purpose adequately until it was decided that Space was not going to be the best communication tool moving forward. After moving team communications to Discord, a new place for project documentation was required as well. This wiki is inspired by the GitLab Handbook, which is a very extensive knowledge-base of documentation about GitLab, the organization, and its processes. 

The GitLab Handbook is built with the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/), which was the original technology choice for this wiki, but configuring it proved more complicated than the effort was worth. [Astro](https://astro.build/) was ultimately chosen as the engine for generating the documentation site as it requires minimal configuration and customizing it with TailwindCSS and AlpineJS is very easy.

## Advantages

The Coderos Wiki aims to be an extensive and relevant resource for both internal and external documentation. Maintaining such a system has the following benefits:

1. Reading documentation is more scalable than attending meetings
2. Reading documentation is asynchronous and can be done on your own time with no need for waiting for someone to be available
3. Prospective new crew members can familiarize themselves with how we operate before deciding to join
4. Linking to documentation is faster than repeating information
5. Improvements can be made by any crew member through a peer review process
