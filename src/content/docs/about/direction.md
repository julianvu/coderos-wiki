## Overview

The Coderos Wiki aims to be the single source of truth for the crew and the Coderos project, including processes, policies, and product direction.

The wiki is open to everyone in the world to view, and welcomes feedback from all.

### Target Audience

**Coderos Crew Members:** Every Coderos crew member is responsible for using and updating our wiki. It is the central knowledge base for process documentation and product direction.

**Leadership:** Coderos currently operates under the captaincy of Julian Vu, who uses the wiki just like any other crew member, but additionally needs to reference the content during meetings. This will allow for finding areas of improvement in the wiki. 

**Prospective Crew Members:** Currently, crew members must be invited by the captain to participate in the development of the Coderos project. Invitations are typically extended to particularly talented students in the courses that the captain teaches. These prospective crew members should use the wiki to learn about expectations for the role, the crew's values, and other policies. 

**Current and Potential Users:** The product direction, strategy, and vision of Coderos are documented in the wiki alongside our crew processes. This allows users to understand future priorities and help potential users make an informed decision related to adopting Coderos as a tool.
